# Social-Distancing-Tool
Project Idea is to train an object detection model which can detect humans in a video and results in all the bounding boxes with humans upon which I have calculated the distance between boxes. Bounding boxes in closer than a threshold value are classified with different color. Also created Bird's eye view using which we can avoid overlapping.
